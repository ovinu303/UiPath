# UiPath Custom Name Creator
This project asks you to enter your name in a dialog box.
It then opens a pre-set url in Firefox browser, writes and submits the name you entered in step 2 to the website.
It then automatically retrieves your Unicorn name as generated by the website, and displays it for you in a dialog box.
